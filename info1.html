                    <h4>Inheritance of eye color - genetics</h4>
                    <p>
                        The inheritance of eye color depends not only on parents, but also on distant ancestors.
                        Eye color is the result of different combinations of genes. A very important<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> role is
                        played by dominant and recessive genes. The inheritance pattern of eye color can be
                        described as complex due to the number of genes that are responsible for eye color.
                        Although you can try to predict the color of the eyes of a child by looking at the color
                        of the parents' eyes, there is a chance that the baby will have an unexpected color. 
                        Turns out eye color inheritance and genetics can be quite surprising. From the mother and
                        father, the baby receives one version of a given gene - dominant or recessive. The color
                        of a child's eyes depends on the pairing of genes that are passed on by each parent.
                        There are many possibilities. The dominant gene is responsible for dark eye color, and
                        the recessive gene is responsible for light eyes. When the father passes on the dominant
                        (stronger) gene to the child, and the mother the recessive one, the child will have dark
                        eyes. It can also happen that when a woman has blue eyes color and a man has brown eyes,
                        the child may have blue eyes. This is because the gene always comes in two versions,
                        so if the father passes the recessive gene on to his child, he will have blue eyes.
                        It is even possible that when parents have the same eye color, their offspring may have
                        a different eye color, e.g. blue eyed parents may have brown eyed offspring. How do you
                        explain this when school genetics makes it clear that two recessive genes cannot produce
                        a dominant gene?</span>

                    <h4>Inheritance of eye color - what effect does melanin have?</h4>
                    <p>
                        A child of parents with blue eyes may have a dark color due to melanin (black pigment),
                        because the color of the eyes is conditioned by its amount. The ratio of eumelanin<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> (dark
                        brown pigment) to pheomelanin (reddish pigment) is also important. The more melanin a
                        person has, the darker their eyes are. Based on the rules of inheritance of eye color
                        and genetics, it turns out that brown eyes are the most common genetic eye color - it
                        affects about 90 percent people in the world. Then 7 per cent. people have a blue color,
                        2 percent. gray 1 percent green.</span>

                    <h4>Eye color inheritance and heterochromia</h4>
                    <p>
                        The inheritance of eye color can be associated with a very rare genetic defect -
                        heterochromia. 1% suffer from it. population. It consists in the fact that there is<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">
                        a heterogeneity of one iris or both eyes. A person affected by this birth defect may have
                        one blue eye and the other brown eye, or one eye may be of two different colors.
                        Fortunately, this defect is not the cause of complications in the organ of sight - it is 
                        not troublesome, but only visible.</span>
