                    <h4>What are blood groups?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The division into groups is conditioned by the presence or absence of specific antigens
                        in the blood and the related presence of specific antibodies. There are several<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> layouts,
                        and in each of them the appropriate groups are distinguished. The two most studied and
                        most important systems are the AB0 system (according to which there are groups: A, B, AB
                        and 0) and the Rh system (in which there are groups: Rh+ and Rh-).

                    <h4>AB0 group arrangement</h4>
                    <p>
                        The AB0 system, the first group system to be discovered, remains the most important
                        system in transfusiology and transplantology. There are two antigens<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> (particles present
                        on blood cells): A and B. There are four blood groups in the AB0 system:                    
                        A - A antigen present, B – B antigen present, AB – A and B antigen present, 0 - no A
                        and B antigen.

                    <h4>Inheritance of AB0 blood groups</h4>
                    <p>
                        The child inherits the blood group from the parents. There are three alleles that
                        determine the AB0 blood group: Ia, Ib, and i0. Ia and Ib alleles are<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> dominant, while
                        i0 is recessive. Each person has two blood type alleles - one from the mother, the
                        other from the father. Dominant alleles (as the name suggests) predominate over the
                        recessive allele. This means that if a person has two alleles - dominant and recessive,
                        then his or her blood type will match the dominant allele. Dominant alleles are
                        equivalent to each other. According to this: people with alleles: Ia i0 and Ia Ia have
                        blood group A, people with alleles: Ib i0 and Ib Ib have blood group B, people with
                        alleles: Ia Ib have blood group AB, people with alleles: i0 i0 have blood group 0.

                    <h4>Blood groups in the Rh system</h4>
                    <p>
                        Inheritance of the blood group in the Rh system is carried out on a similar basis as in
                        the system AB0. The presence of the D antigen on the blood cells indicates the<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4"> Rh+ blood
                        group, the allele that determines the group blood type is Rh+ is dominant (D) to the
                        allele (d) that determines the blood group Rh- (none D antigen on blood cells). Each
                        parent passes on one allele to the child. Means, that if both parents are Rh+ or one of
                        the parents is Rh-, then a child can have both Rh+ and Rh- blood types. But if both
                        parents have Rh- blood group, the child will have Rh- blood group. Rh antigens are bound
                        to red blood cells and are not found on other cells. The D antigen is responsible for
                        the blood group in the Rh system. People who have this antigen have the Rh+ (Rh-positive)
                        blood group. People who lack this protein have Rh- (Rh-negative) blood type. Anti-D
                        antibodies, unlike anti-A and anti-B antibodies, do not occur as natural antibodies,
                        they do not appear on their own. They arise as a result of the leakage of red blood
                        cells (erythrocytes) of a Rh-positive fetus into the bloodstream of a Rh-negative woman
                        during pregnancy or childbirth (most often), after transfusion of Rh-positive red blood
                        cells to a Rh-negative patient, sometimes also as a result of contact with foreign blood
                        during intravenous administration drugs. The Rh system is important for pregnant women
                        because incompatibility between maternal and fetal groups is important in the
                        development of serological conflict. This only applies if the mother is Rh- and the
                        fetus is Rh+.
